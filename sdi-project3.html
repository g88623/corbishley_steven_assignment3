<p>For this story, I decided to continue using my theme from work, as it fits very well with the projects we have been doing. I did not reuse any code from previous weeks, as this week allowed for more freedom since we did not have a pre-defined flowchart.</p>
<p>One thing I included was a way of auto-assigning cases from a queue to bring down the number to a more manageable number of cases. In this, I also included logic that determines whether a certain person is in the office, and if they are out of the office it will skip over them.</p>
